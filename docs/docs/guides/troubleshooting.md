# Troubleshooting

Common issues and how to resolve them.

---

## First Step: Enable HTTP Traffic Logging

When something does not behave as expected, enable HTTP traffic logging.
This shows every request and response exchanged between Contracteer and the server.

For JVM projects, set the `tech.sabai.contracteer.http` logger to DEBUG:

```yaml
# application.yaml (Spring Boot)
logging:
  level:
    tech.sabai.contracteer.http: DEBUG
```

For the CLI, add the `-t` flag:

```bash
contracteer verify openapi.yaml -t
contracteer mock openapi.yaml -t
```

Contracteer also logs automatically at WARN level when a verification case fails or the mock server returns a 418.

---

## Verifier Issues

### All verification cases fail with the wrong status code

**Symptom:** Every scenario-based case expects `200` but the server returns `404`.

**Cause:** The test data is not seeded, or the seeded IDs do not match the OpenAPI example values.

**Fix:** Ensure the seeded data matches the request examples.
If the `ATHOS` scenario sends `GET /musketeers/1`, a musketeer with id `1` must exist in the database.
See [Prepare Test Data](../getting-started/verifier-junit.md#prepare-test-data) for the full pattern.

### Type-mismatch cases fail with 500 instead of 400

**Symptom:** Automatic type-mismatch verification cases expect `400` but the server returns `500`.

**Cause:** The server does not validate input types, or it throws an unhandled exception instead of returning a proper `400` response.

**Fix:** Add input validation to your server.
For Spring Boot, ensure type-mismatch exceptions are mapped to `400` responses.
The response must use the content type and schema declared in your OpenAPI document (e.g., `application/problem+json` with a ProblemDetail body).

### Response body validation fails

**Symptom:** The verification case reports errors like `'name': expected type 'string' but got 'integer'` or `'email': required field missing`.

**Cause:** The server's response does not conform to the schema declared in the OpenAPI document.

**Fix:** Compare the server's actual response (visible in DEBUG logs) against the schema.
Common causes:

- A field has the wrong type (e.g., returning a number as a string).
- A required field is missing from the response.
- The `Content-Type` header does not match the declared media type.

### "Additional properties are not allowed"

**Symptom:** The verifier rejects a response or the mock server rejects a request with "Additional properties are not allowed. Unexpected properties: ..."

**Cause:** The schema declares `additionalProperties: false` and the body contains a field not listed in the schema's `properties`.

**Fix:** Contracteer enforces `additionalProperties: false` as a declared constraint, even though the default behavior is tolerant of extra fields.
Either add the field to the schema's `properties`, or remove `additionalProperties: false` if the constraint is not intentional.

### No scenarios created for an operation

**Symptom:** An operation has examples in the OpenAPI document, but Contracteer does not generate scenario-based verification cases for it.

**Cause:** The example keys exist only on the request side or only on the response side.
Contracteer needs at least one shared key between request and response elements.

**Fix:** Ensure the same example key appears on both a request element (parameter or request body) and a response element (header or response body).
See [Common Mistakes](../concepts/scenarios.md#common-mistakes) for details.

### "Ambiguous match for oneOf"

**Symptom:** The verifier or mock server rejects a request or response with "Ambiguous match for 'oneOf'. The provided value matches multiple schemas."

**Cause:** The `oneOf` variants have overlapping structures.
Without `required` properties, `additionalProperties: false`, or a `discriminator`, a valid value for one variant inevitably matches others too.

**Fix:** Either replace `oneOf` with `anyOf` if multiple matches are acceptable, or make the variants distinguishable.
To distinguish variants, add `required` properties unique to each variant, set `additionalProperties: false`, use a `discriminator`, or constrain the variants with `pattern` or `enum`.

### "No schema found for discriminator"

**Symptom:** The verifier or mock server rejects a body with "No schema found for discriminator property 'X' with value: Y".

**Cause:** The body's discriminator value (`Y`) is not listed in the discriminator's `mapping` and does not match the name of any sub-schema.

**Fix:** Either add the value to the `mapping`, or change the body to use a value that is already mapped or matches an existing schema name.

### Polymorphic body passes validation without checking child-specific properties

**Symptom:** A body for a parent schema with a discriminator is accepted even when its child-specific properties are wrong or missing.

**Cause:** The parent schema is referenced directly via `$ref` at the usage site.
The OpenAPI Specification defines this form as non-validating: "The `allOf` form of `discriminator` is _only_ useful for non-validation use cases."

**Fix:** Replace the direct `$ref` to the parent with a `oneOf` or `anyOf` listing the child schemas explicitly, and keep the discriminator at that usage site.
See [Discriminator on a parent schema used via `$ref`](../concepts/openapi-coverage.md#discriminator-on-a-parent-schema-used-via-ref) for an example.

---

## Mock Server Issues

### Getting 418 instead of the expected response

**Symptom:** The mock server returns `418` instead of the response you expected.

**Cause:** The 418 is Contracteer's diagnostic signal.
It means the mock server received the request but cannot determine the correct response.

**Fix:** Read the 418 response body -- it explains what went wrong.
Common causes:

- **No scenario matches.** The request values do not exactly match any scenario's example values.
  Check that your request sends the exact values from the OpenAPI examples.
- **Multiple scenarios match.** The request matches more than one scenario.
  Make your example values more specific to distinguish them.
- **Multiple 2xx response codes.** The operation defines more than one success status code and no scenario disambiguates.
  Add scenarios to target specific status codes.

See [The 418 Diagnostic Response](../concepts/testing-your-client.md#the-418-diagnostic-response) for a full explanation.

### Getting 400 when expecting 200

**Symptom:** The mock server returns `400` for a request you believe is valid.

**Cause:** The request violates the OpenAPI schema.
The mock server validates every request against the full schema -- including types, required fields, enum constraints, and string formats.

**Fix:** Compare your request against the schema.
Common causes:

- A required field is missing from the request body.
- A field value is not in the declared enum.
- A parameter has the wrong type (e.g., a string where an integer is expected).
- The `Content-Type` header does not match the declared media type.

Enable DEBUG logging to see the exact request the mock server received.

### Request rejected for sending a readOnly field

**Symptom:** The mock server rejects a request with "Additional properties are not allowed" for a field like `id`.

**Cause:** The field is marked `readOnly: true` in the schema and the schema has `additionalProperties: false`.
Contracteer excludes `readOnly` properties from the request schema.
If the client sends a `readOnly` field, it is treated as an unexpected additional property.

**Fix:** Remove the `readOnly` field from your request.
`readOnly` properties like `id` are server-generated -- they belong in responses, not in requests.

### Verifier fails because a writeOnly field is missing from the response

**Symptom:** The verifier reports a missing required field for a property like `password`.

**Cause:** The field is marked `writeOnly: true` in the schema.
Contracteer excludes `writeOnly` properties from the response schema.
If the field is also `required`, the server should not return it and the verifier should not expect it.

**Fix:** This is usually correct behavior.
If the verifier fails, check that the field is actually marked `writeOnly: true` in your OpenAPI document.
If it is, the server should not include it in responses.

### Extraction fails with minProperties/maxProperties and readOnly/writeOnly

**Symptom:** Loading the OpenAPI document fails with an error about `minProperties`/`maxProperties` combined with `readOnly` or `writeOnly` properties.

**Cause:** The OpenAPI Specification does not define how `minProperties`/`maxProperties` interact with `readOnly`/`writeOnly`.
When properties are excluded from request or response schemas, the property count constraints become ambiguous.
Contracteer rejects this combination to avoid silent misinterpretation.

**Fix:** Remove either the `minProperties`/`maxProperties` constraint or the `readOnly`/`writeOnly` annotations from the affected object schema.

### Response values are random and different on each run

**Symptom:** The mock server returns valid responses, but the values change on every request.

**Cause:** The request does not match any scenario.
When no scenario matches, the mock server generates a response from the schema with random values.

**Fix:** This is expected behavior when no scenario is defined for the request.
If you need deterministic responses, define scenarios in your OpenAPI document.
Use `examples` on both request and response elements.
See [Creating Scenarios](../concepts/scenarios.md) for how to do this.

---

## OpenAPI Document Issues

### Equivalent paths rejected

**Symptom:** Loading the OpenAPI document fails with "Equivalent paths found: '/resources/{resourceId}/items' and '/resources/{parentId}/items'."

**Cause:** The OpenAPI document defines two paths that differ only in parameter names.
The OpenAPI Specification considers these identical and invalid because both match the same set of URLs.
Parameter types and constraints do not matter -- equivalence is purely structural.

**Fix:** Rename one of the paths so that the static segments differ, or merge both operations under a single path.

---

### Circular schema reference rejected

**Symptom:** Loading the OpenAPI document fails with "Circular reference with no optional, nullable, or collection exit point."

**Cause:** The OpenAPI document contains a circular `$ref` chain where every property in the cycle is required and non-nullable.
This describes an infinite structure that cannot be instantiated.

For example, `Node.next → Link.target → Node` where both `next` and `target` are required and non-nullable creates a structure with no valid finite value.

**Fix:** Break the cycle by making at least one property in the chain optional (remove it from `required`), nullable (`nullable: true` on the referenced schema), or a collection (`type: array`).
Any of these gives Contracteer a finite stopping point.

### Sibling keyword on `$ref` is rejected

**Symptom:** Loading an OpenAPI 3.1 document fails with a message such as `Schema 'X': sibling 'propertyNames' on '$ref' is not supported.`

**Cause:** A Schema Object combines `$ref` with a sibling keyword Contracteer does not merge.
Supported siblings cover type, length and numeric bounds, enum and const, required, properties, items, additionalProperties, multipleOf, pattern, uniqueItems, and item/property count bounds.
Other keywords are rejected as siblings -- even when Contracteer supports them standalone (for example `propertyNames`) and even when JSON Schema 2020-12 itself defines them (`if`/`then`/`else`, `dependentRequired`, JSON Schema applicators, and so on).

**Fix:** Declare the unsupported keyword on the referenced schema, so it applies wherever the schema is used.
If the constraint must apply only to this usage, factor it into a new component schema and reference that one instead.

```yaml
# Rejected -- propertyNames as a sibling
Headers:
  $ref: '#/components/schemas/HeaderMap'
  propertyNames:
    pattern: '^[A-Z][A-Za-z-]*$'

# Accepted -- propertyNames declared on the referenced schema
Headers:
  $ref: '#/components/schemas/HttpHeaderMap'
HttpHeaderMap:
  type: object
  propertyNames:
    pattern: '^[A-Z][A-Za-z-]*$'
  additionalProperties:
    type: string
```

See [`$ref` with sibling keywords](../concepts/openapi-coverage.md#ref-with-sibling-keywords) for the full list of supported siblings.

---

### Sibling type conflicts with referenced target

**Symptom:** Loading the OpenAPI document fails with `Schema 'X': sibling 'type: A' conflicts with referenced target type 'B'`.

**Cause:** The schema declares both `$ref: '#/components/schemas/Foo'` and a sibling `type` that differs from `Foo`'s effective type.
Implicit `allOf` semantics require the instance to satisfy both the target and the sibling, but a value cannot be two distinct types at once.

**Fix:** Remove the sibling `type` if it was a defensive redeclaration of the same type, or change the reference to a schema of the intended type.

---

### Sibling enum or const not in the target

**Symptom:** Loading the OpenAPI document fails with `Schema 'X': sibling 'enum' contains values not in target 'enum' (extras: 'A', 'B')` or `Schema 'X': sibling 'const: A' is not in target 'enum' (...)`.

**Cause:** The target schema declares an `enum` (or `const`), and the sibling tries to add values the target does not allow.
Siblings narrow the target; they cannot widen it.

**Fix:** Make the sibling `enum` (or `const`) a subset of the target's `enum`, or remove values from the sibling that are not in the target.
If you need a strictly larger value set, define a new component schema rather than referencing the existing one.

---

### Sibling and target both define the same field

**Symptom:** Loading the OpenAPI document fails with `Schema 'X': sibling 'properties' overlaps target on 'name'. Define each property in only one of the two.`, or a similar message for `items`, `additionalProperties`, `pattern`, or `multipleOf`.

**Cause:** Contracteer does not recursively merge two definitions of the same property, item schema, or pattern.
The implicit `allOf` semantics would require both definitions to be satisfied simultaneously, which is well defined in the JSON Schema specification but not implemented for these keywords.

**Fix:** Define the field in only one place.
For `properties`, move the overlapping property into either the target schema or the sibling.
For `pattern` and `multipleOf`, drop one side or factor the schemas differently.

---

### `$ref` with siblings forms a cycle

**Symptom:** Loading the OpenAPI document fails with `Schema 'X': '$ref' with sibling keywords forms a cycle (X -> Y -> X). Cyclic merges cannot be resolved.`

**Cause:** Two or more component schemas reference each other via `$ref` and each step carries sibling keywords.
Each merge would need to expand into the next one, and the chain never terminates.

**Fix:** Break the cycle by removing the sibling keywords from at least one step in the chain.
If both ends genuinely need to constrain the other, express the relationship through `allOf` composition rather than `$ref` with siblings.

---

### `$ref` cannot resolve JSON Pointer

**Symptom:** Loading the OpenAPI document fails with a message such as `$ref '#/$defs/Order': cannot resolve JSON Pointer -- segment '$defs' is not supported in Contracteer` or `$ref '#/components/schemas/Order/properties/total': cannot resolve JSON Pointer -- Schema has no field 'total'`.

**Cause:** A `$ref` points into a part of the document Contracteer's resolver cannot reach.
Contracteer resolves `$ref` pointers under `#/components/schemas`, `#/components/parameters`, `#/components/responses`, `#/components/headers`, `#/components/requestBodies`, and `#/components/examples`.
Pointers into `$defs`, `definitions`, or into the content of `examples` and `requestBodies` are rejected.

**Fix:** Move the target schema into `#/components/schemas` and update the `$ref` accordingly.
Contracteer resolves JSON Pointers into nested Schema locations (for example `#/components/schemas/User/properties/address`), so deep targets within a Schema work as long as the entry point is a supported components section.
See [References](../concepts/openapi-coverage.md#references-ref) for the full list of supported `$ref` forms.

### Recursive array generates fewer items than minItems

**Symptom:** The verifier reports "Array has 0 items but minItems is N" on a recursive schema property.

**Cause:** The schema contains a recursive `$ref` cycle through an array property with a `minItems` constraint.
At the recursion depth limit, Contracteer generates an empty array to avoid producing null values for non-nullable items.
This may violate the `minItems` constraint.

**Fix:** Remove the `minItems` constraint from the recursive array property, or make the array items nullable.
Recursive arrays with `minItems` describe a structure that requires infinite depth to satisfy -- no finite value can conform.

### Generated value is smaller than the OpenAPI document declares

**Symptom:** Generated request or response bodies contain fewer items, missing optional properties, or omitted sub-trees compared to what the OpenAPI schema declares.

**Cause:** Contracteer bounds the size of generated values to protect against heap exhaustion on schemas with deep mutual recursion or large declared array bounds.
When the limit is reached, Contracteer stops generating deeper values, producing the same empty-array and omitted-property fallbacks it uses for cycle boundaries.

**Fix:** Reduce `minItems`/`maxItems` on large recursive arrays, or simplify deeply interconnected schemas.
The size limit is a safety net: schemas that describe pathologically large structures produce correspondingly bounded generated values.

### OpenAPI document loading fails

**Symptom:** Contracteer reports errors when loading the OpenAPI document.

**Common causes:**

- **Invalid YAML or JSON.** Check syntax with a YAML linter.
- **Unsupported OpenAPI version.** Contracteer supports OpenAPI 3.0 and 3.1.
  Other versions (Swagger 2.0, OpenAPI 4.x) are rejected at load time.
- **`example` and `examples` on the same element.** The OpenAPI Specification declares these mutually exclusive.
  Contracteer rejects the OpenAPI document if both are present on the same parameter or media type.
- **Multiple composition keywords on the same schema.** A schema combining `allOf`, `anyOf`, or `oneOf` at the same level is rejected.
  Restructure the schema to use a single composition keyword.
  See [Multiple composition keywords](../concepts/openapi-coverage.md#multiple-composition-keywords-on-the-same-schema) for the recommended pattern.

### Extraction fails with nested types in parameter styles

**Symptom:** Loading the OpenAPI document fails with "does not support objects with nested objects or arrays in properties (undefined behavior in the OpenAPI document)" or "does not support arrays with nested objects or arrays as items (undefined behavior in the OpenAPI document)."

**Cause:** A flat-style parameter (`simple`, `form`, `label`, `matrix`) or a `deepObject` query parameter has a schema that nests structured values beyond what the OpenAPI Specification defines. Examples:

- A query parameter with `type: array` whose `items` are themselves objects or arrays (e.g., `?inputs[]={_path: "/x"}` has no spec-defined serialization).
- A query parameter with `type: object` whose properties include nested objects or arrays.
- A `form-urlencoded` request body with the same nested shapes.

OpenAPI's style table only defines serialization one level deep. `deepObject` extends this for flat objects but still excludes arrays and nested structures.

**Fix:** Restructure the schema to use only primitive property values and primitive array items, switch to a JSON-encoded parameter using the `content` keyword instead of `style`/`explode`, or move the structured payload into the request body.

### Extraction fails with `additionalProperties` on a form-explode query object

**Symptom:** Loading the OpenAPI document fails with "Style 'form' with explode=true cannot enforce 'additionalProperties' constraints: the encoding does not distinguish properties of this object from other query parameters."

**Cause:** A query parameter uses `style: form` (the default), `explode: true` (the default for query), `type: object`, and either `additionalProperties: false` or `additionalProperties: <schema>`.
The form/explode encoding flattens object properties into top-level query keys (`?R=100&G=200`), so Contracteer cannot tell whether an undeclared key like `?foo=bar` is an extra property of the object or an unrelated query parameter.
Enforcing `additionalProperties` under that ambiguity would either misvalidate unrelated parameters or silently never reject anything.

**Fix:** Switch the parameter to `style: deepObject`. Its `paramName[key]` syntax unambiguously scopes properties, so `additionalProperties` works correctly.

```yaml
parameters:
  - in: query
    name: color
    style: deepObject
    explode: true
    schema:
      type: object
      properties:
        R: { type: integer }
        G: { type: integer }
        B: { type: integer }
      additionalProperties: false
```

If the constraint isn't load-bearing, set `additionalProperties: true` (or remove it) to keep `style: form`.

### Composed schema has branches with incompatible kinds

**Symptom:** Loading the OpenAPI document fails with `composed schemas define incompatible kinds: 'primitive' vs 'object'` (or any other kind pair).

**Cause:** Two branches of a `oneOf` or `anyOf` declare the same property name with different kinds -- one as a primitive, another as an object or array.
The composition is used in a type-blind wire format (`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/*`, `deepObject`, or one of the flat parameter styles).
For these formats, the wire bytes carry no information about which branch's interpretation applies, so Contracteer cannot decode the value.
The same composition is accepted in `application/json` bodies, where the wire format disambiguates.

**Fix:** Either restructure the composition so colliding properties share a kind, split the operation into multiple operations with distinct request bodies, or move the composition into an `application/json` body.

```yaml
# Rejected on form-urlencoded -- 'value' is primitive in one branch, object in another
oneOf:
  - type: object
    properties:
      kind: { type: string, enum: [text] }
      value: { type: string }
  - type: object
    properties:
      kind: { type: string, enum: [count] }
      value:
        type: object
        properties:
          n: { type: integer }
```

Use `application/json` instead, or split the operation so each request body declares only one of the shapes.

See [Composed schemas with incompatible branches](../concepts/openapi-coverage.md#composed-schemas-with-incompatible-branches) for the full rationale.

### Multipart part has composed schema with no default content type

**Symptom:** Loading the OpenAPI document fails with `Cannot determine default content type for multipart part: schema branches have incompatible shapes. Specify 'contentType' explicitly in the encoding to resolve.`

**Cause:** A multipart part's schema is a composition whose branches have incompatible encoding shapes (e.g., a primitive branch and an object branch).
The OpenAPI Specification defaults a multipart part's content type from its schema shape -- `text/plain` for primitives, `application/json` for objects and arrays.
When the branches give different shapes, no single default applies.

**Fix:** Declare the part's content type explicitly on the `encoding` object.

```yaml
requestBody:
  content:
    multipart/form-data:
      schema:
        type: object
        properties:
          payload:
            oneOf:
              - type: string
              - type: object
                properties:
                  count: { type: integer }
      encoding:
        payload:
          contentType: application/json
```

### `type: null` is rejected as a body or parameter schema

**Symptom:** Loading the OpenAPI document fails with `standalone 'type: null' is not a meaningful schema. For a nullable value, use 'anyOf: [Type, {type: null}]'. For an empty response, omit the 'content' field and use status code 204.`

**Cause:** A request body, response body, parameter, or header declares `type: null` as its top-level schema.
A `null`-only schema carries no useful constraint: the wire value can never be anything but `null`, so the schema neither validates a payload nor describes a value to generate.
The pattern is almost always one of two author mistakes -- modeling "empty response" with `type: null` instead of HTTP `204`, or modeling "nullable value" with `type: null` instead of `anyOf: [Type, {type: null}]`.

**Fix:** Replace the standalone `type: null` with the construct that matches your intent:

```yaml
# Empty response: drop the content map and use status 204
responses:
  '204':
    description: No content

# Nullable value: use anyOf with the actual type and a null branch
parameters:
  - name: tombstone
    in: query
    schema:
      anyOf:
        - type: string
        - type: "null"
```

`type: null` remains valid as a property schema, an array item schema, or an `additionalProperties` schema -- only the top-level body or parameter use is rejected.
See [`type: null`](../concepts/openapi-coverage.md#type-null) for the full position rules.

### Outer `type` excludes null but a composition branch declares it

**Symptom:** Loading the OpenAPI document fails with `outer 'type: [object]' constrains type but the 'anyOf' branch '#1' declares 'type: null'. Either add 'null' to the outer type array or remove the null branch.`

**Cause:** An `anyOf` or `oneOf` schema declares both an outer `type` array (excluding `"null"`) and a sub-branch that uses `type: "null"`.
The two constraints contradict each other: the outer type restricts the value to non-null types, while the null branch claims `null` is a valid match.

**Fix:** Decide which side of the contradiction reflects the actual contract:

```yaml
# If null is acceptable: add "null" to the outer type array
schema:
  type: ["object", "null"]
  anyOf:
    - type: object
      properties: { ... }
    - type: "null"

# If null is not acceptable: remove the null branch
schema:
  type: ["object"]
  anyOf:
    - type: object
      properties: { ... }
```

### `allOf` includes a `type: null` branch

**Symptom:** Loading the OpenAPI document fails with `'allOf' includes a 'type: null' branch (#1) which is unsatisfiable: a value cannot match both the null type and any non-null branch. Use 'anyOf' if a nullable union is intended, or remove the null branch.`

**Cause:** An `allOf` composition includes a `type: null` sub-schema.
`allOf` requires the value to match *every* branch simultaneously.
A null value satisfies the null branch but cannot satisfy any non-null branch; a non-null value satisfies the non-null branches but cannot satisfy the null branch.
The schema therefore admits no value, which is almost always an author error.

**Fix:** If the intent is a nullable composition, replace `allOf` with `anyOf`:

```yaml
# Nullable composition (any of the branches, including null)
schema:
  anyOf:
    - allOf:
        - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Pet'
        - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Owned'
    - type: "null"
```

If the null branch was added by mistake, remove it -- `allOf` of the remaining branches expresses the original intent.

### Extraction fails with non-JSON content type and structured schema

**Symptom:** Loading the OpenAPI document fails with "Content type [text/plain|text/html|application/jwt] supports only primitive schemas."

**Cause:** A request or response body uses a media type that has no standard serialization for structured values -- `text/plain`, `text/html`, and `application/jwt` all describe scalar textual content.
The OpenAPI Specification does not define how to serialize an object, array, or composition for these media types, so any implementation would rely on an implicit convention between the document author and the client.
Contracteer rejects the combination at load time rather than silently applying a guess.

**Fix:** Change the content type to `application/json` if the schema describes a structured value, or simplify the schema to a primitive type if the content type must remain as declared.

### No scenarios created at all

**Symptom:** The OpenAPI document has example values, but Contracteer creates no scenarios.

**Cause:** The examples are defined under `schema.properties` instead of on the parameter or media type.
Contracteer reads examples from parameters and media types, not from schema properties.

```yaml
# This does NOT produce a scenario
schema:
  type: object
  properties:
    name:
      type: string
      example: Athos    # not used by Contracteer
```

**Fix:** Move examples to the parameter or media type level using the `examples` or `example` keyword.
See [Creating Scenarios](../concepts/scenarios.md) for the correct placement.

### Warning about ignored pattern or length constraints

**Symptom:** Contracteer logs a warning like "pattern ignored because format takes precedence" or "minLength/maxLength ignored because pattern takes precedence."

**Cause:** Your schema combines constraints that Contracteer applies in precedence order: `format` > `pattern` > `minLength`/`maxLength`.
The lower-priority constraint is ignored for both validation and generation.

**Fix:** This is intentional.
See [String constraint precedence](../concepts/openapi-coverage.md#string-constraint-precedence) for the full explanation.
If you need the pattern to apply, remove the `format`.
If you need length constraints to apply, remove the `pattern`.

### Pattern not supported for value generation

**Symptom:** Loading the OpenAPI document fails with "pattern is not supported for value generation."

**Cause:** The `pattern` is a valid regex but Contracteer cannot generate values that match it.
This happens when the pattern uses constructs the value generator cannot handle, such as:

- Lookahead or lookbehind assertions combined with anchors (e.g., `^(?!foo:)[a-zA-Z]+$`)
- Anchors inside alternation branches (e.g., `(?:^foo$)|(?:^bar$)`)
- Deeply nested quantifiers that overflow the regex engine (e.g., `[a-z]{0,63}:[a-z]{0,63}:.{0,1023}`)
- Inline flag modifiers (e.g., `(?i)foo`)

Contracteer automatically rewrites common Java-specific constructs (POSIX classes like `\p{Print}`, Java aliases like `\p{IsLetter}`, dash-position issues in character classes) into compatible equivalents.
Patterns that cannot be rewritten are rejected at load time.

**Fix:** Provide OpenAPI `examples` on the parameter or media type to create scenarios with explicit values for this property.
Contracteer uses scenario values instead of generating random ones, bypassing the pattern limitation entirely.
See [Creating Scenarios](../concepts/scenarios.md) for how to provide examples.
Alternatively, simplify the pattern to use standard character classes and quantifiers without lookaround assertions.

### Header pattern, enum, or example admits invalid HTTP characters

**Symptom:** Loading the OpenAPI document fails with an error naming a header and referencing RFC 7230 §3.2.6, for example:

```
Header 'X-Custom-Attributes' may carry character U+0000 not valid in HTTP
header values per RFC 7230 §3.2.6. Tighten the schema (pattern, enum) or
correct example values to exclude control and non-ASCII characters.
```

**Cause:** The header schema declares a `pattern`, `enum`, or `example` that admits characters disallowed in HTTP header values.
RFC 7230 §3.2.6 restricts header field-values to visible ASCII (`0x21-0x7E`), space (`0x20`), and horizontal tab (`0x09`).
Patterns like `\p{ASCII}*` or `\p{Print}*` legally admit NUL, CR, LF, DEL, and non-ASCII characters that no HTTP client will accept on the wire.

Contracteer samples generated values at load time to catch the problem before verification or mock-server startup, rather than at runtime when the transport layer rejects the value.

**Fix:** Tighten the schema so that no generated value can contain a disallowed character.
Common replacements:

- `\p{ASCII}*` → `[\x20-\x7E\t]*` (printable ASCII + tab)
- `\p{Print}*` → `[\x20-\x7E]*` (printable ASCII without tab)
- For enum or example values, remove or escape control and non-ASCII characters in the declared literal strings.

If the header legitimately conveys opaque binary or Unicode data, Base64-encode the value in the schema declaration (for example `pattern: '[A-Za-z0-9+/=]*'`) rather than declaring the raw bytes as the header value.

### Unexpected behavior from unsupported schema keywords

**Symptom:** Verification fails or the mock server rejects valid requests / returns wrong responses, even though the OpenAPI document looks correct.

**Cause:** Your OpenAPI document uses an OpenAPI schema keyword that Contracteer does not support.
The keyword is silently ignored, which changes validation behavior.

Common examples:

- **`default`** on a property.
  The verifier may omit an optional property when the server expects the default value.

**Fix:** Check the [OpenAPI Coverage](../concepts/openapi-coverage.md) page for the full list of supported and unsupported keywords.
If your OpenAPI document relies on an unsupported keyword, you may need to work around it until support is added.

### Operations missing from verification

**Symptom:** Some operations in your OpenAPI document are not tested.
Contracteer produces no verification cases for them.

**Cause:** The operation uses a feature that Contracteer does not support.
Operations are skipped when they use:

- `application/xml` content types.
- Request or response bodies declared without a schema (e.g., `application/json: {}`).
- Parameters using the `content` keyword without a schema.

Contracteer logs a warning for each skipped operation.

**Fix:** Add a schema to the content type declaration, or remove the content type if no schema is needed.
Check the [OpenAPI Coverage](../concepts/openapi-coverage.md) page for the full list of supported features.

### Confusing `example` and `examples`

`example` provides a single value.
`examples` is a named map where each entry has a `value` field:

```yaml
# Single value
example: 42

# Named map -- each name is an example key
examples:
  ATHOS:
    value: 42
  PORTHOS:
    value: 43
```

Both are valid.
Contracteer uses both for scenario creation.
See [OpenAPI Examples](../concepts/scenarios.md#openapi-examples-examples-and-example) for details.
