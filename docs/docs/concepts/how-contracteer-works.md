# How Contracteer Works

Contracteer reads your OpenAPI specification and provides two tools.
The **verifier** tests your server against the specification.
The **mock server** gives your client tests a strict, spec-compliant API to run against.
Both derive their behavior entirely from the specification -- no handwritten mocks, no manually maintained test cases.

## The Musketeer API

Throughout this documentation, we use the [Musketeer API](https://github.com/sabai-tech/contracteer-examples) -- a small REST API for managing musketeers and their missions.

!!! note "Why musketeers?"
    Contracteer is a portmanteau of *Contract* and *Musketeer* -- because every API deserves a loyal guard defending its contract.

Here is the `GET /musketeers/{id}` operation from its OpenAPI specification:

```yaml
# Excerpt from musketeer-api.yaml
# Full spec: https://github.com/sabai-tech/contracteer-examples
paths:
  /musketeers/{id}:
    get:
      summary: Get a musketeer by ID
      parameters:
        - name: id
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: integer
          examples:
            ATHOS:
              value: 1
            404_UNKNOWN_MUSKETEER:
              value: 999
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Musketeer found
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Musketeer'
              examples:
                ATHOS:
                  value:
                    id: 1
                    name: Athos
                    rank: MUSKETEER
                    weapon: Rapier
        '404':
          description: Musketeer not found
        '400':
          description: Invalid musketeer ID
          content:
            application/problem+json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/ProblemDetail'
# Musketeer and ProblemDetail schemas omitted — see full spec
```

From this single operation, Contracteer derives two **scenarios** and one automatic **verification case**.

A **scenario** is a named pairing of specific request values with an expected response for a given status code, derived from OpenAPI examples.
Two scenarios come from this operation:

- **ATHOS** -- the example key `ATHOS` appears on both the request parameter (value `1`) and the response body (Athos's data).
  Contracteer pairs them: send `GET /musketeers/1`, expect a `200` with a response matching the Musketeer schema.
- **404_UNKNOWN_MUSKETEER** -- the example key starts with `404_`, which tells Contracteer to target the 404 response directly.
  Send `GET /musketeers/999`, expect a `404`.

A **verification case** is what Contracteer actually executes.
Every scenario produces a verification case, but Contracteer also generates verification cases automatically.
Here, the specification declares that `id` is an integer and that a `400` response exists.
Contracteer creates an automatic **type-mismatch verification case**: it sends an invalid type (a string instead of an integer) and expects a `400` with a response matching the ProblemDetail schema.

Three verification cases from one operation, covering the happy path, a not-found case, and input validation -- all derived from the specification.

!!! warning
    Contracteer requires every operation to define at least one 2xx response.
    If any operation lacks a 2xx response, Contracteer rejects the specification.

The full mechanics of how scenarios are created are covered in [Creating Scenarios](scenarios.md).

## The Verifier: Testing Your Server

For each verification case, the verifier builds a request, sends it to your real, running server, and validates the response.
It checks the status code, required headers, and response body against the schema's structure and types.
The verifier does **not** check response values against the example values.

This is a deliberate choice.
A contract test verifies **externally observable guarantees** -- the status code and response shape -- not which data the server returned.
If the verifier compared values, it would over-constrain the server: the server would have to return exactly the example data to pass the test.
That turns a contract test into a functional test.
The contract guarantees the **shape** of the response, not its content.
Your server is free to return any data that satisfies the schema.

How the verifier works in depth is covered in [Testing Your Server](testing-your-server.md).

---

## The Mock Server: Testing Your Client

The mock server is a **strict reference implementation** of the API defined by your OpenAPI specification.
It validates every incoming request against the OpenAPI schema and returns spec-compliant responses.

If a request matches a scenario, the mock server returns that scenario's response values.
If the request is valid but matches no scenario, it returns a response generated from the schema.
If the request violates the specification -- wrong types, missing required fields -- it rejects it.

This strictness is what makes the mock server useful for testing.
It enforces the contract on every request.
Your client tests run against an accurate representation of the real API -- fast, in-process, with no external infrastructure.

How the mock server works in depth -- including the 418 diagnostic response and how it fits into your test strategy -- is covered in [Testing Your Client](testing-your-client.md).

---

## An Intentional Asymmetry

The verifier and the mock server are deliberately different in what they enforce.

The verifier tests **representative cases**.
It cannot be exhaustive -- testing every possible request for every operation is not feasible.
Instead, it tests the named scenarios from your examples and automatic cases for error handling.
Its claim is:

> For each verification case, the server responds as the specification says it should.

The mock server validates **every request**.
It cannot afford to be lenient.
If it accepted invalid requests, your client tests would pass locally but fail against the real server.
That would be false confidence.
Its guarantee is:

> Any request the mock server accepts would also be accepted by a correctly-implemented real server.

This asymmetry is required, not accidental.
The verifier proves that your server honors the contract for specific cases.
The mock server proves that your client respects the contract in all cases.

---

## Validate What Is Defined, Ignore What Is Not

Contracteer follows [Postel's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle): *be conservative in what you send, liberal in what you accept*.

The **mock server** validates request elements declared in the specification.
If your client sends an extra query parameter or header that the spec doesn't mention, the mock server does not reject the request.
There is no schema to validate it against.

The **verifier** validates response elements declared in the specification.
If your server returns additional fields beyond what the spec declares, the verifier does not fail.
Those fields are outside the contract's scope.

This tolerance makes contract tests stable across API evolution.
A server can add new response fields without breaking the verifier.
A client can send additional parameters without breaking the mock server.
Only changes to what the specification **defines** are caught -- which is exactly what contract tests should detect.

## Key Takeaways

- Contracteer reads your OpenAPI specification and provides two tools: a verifier (tests your server) and a mock server (tests your client).
- Scenarios are named pairings of request and response values, derived from OpenAPI examples or status-code-prefixed keys.
  Verification cases are what Contracteer executes -- they include scenarios and automatic type-mismatch cases.
- The verifier checks structure and types, not values -- the contract guarantees the shape, not the content.
- The mock server is a strict reference implementation. It enforces the contract on every request, giving your client tests an accurate representation of the real API.
- The two are intentionally asymmetric: the verifier tests representative cases, the mock server validates every request.
- Contracteer follows Postel's Law: it validates what the specification defines and tolerates what it doesn't.
