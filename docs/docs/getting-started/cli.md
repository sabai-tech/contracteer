# Use the CLI

The Contracteer CLI runs verification and starts mock servers from the command line.
It is a standalone native binary -- no JVM installation required.

**Develop against a spec before the server exists.**
Start a mock server from the OpenAPI specification and build your client against it.
Every request is validated against the schema.
Client-side bugs are caught during development -- not after the real server is deployed.

**Verify any server, regardless of language.**
The CLI verifies that a running server conforms to its OpenAPI specification.
It does not matter whether the server is built in Node.js, Python, Go, or any other language.
If it speaks HTTP and has an OpenAPI specification, Contracteer can verify it.

**Integrate into CI/CD pipelines.**
For non-JVM projects, add a verification step to your pipeline without any build tool integration.
The CLI exits with code `0` when all cases pass and `1` when any case fails -- standard CI behavior.

## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS / Linux)

```bash
brew install sabai-tech/contracteer/contracteer
```

### GitHub Releases (all platforms)

Download the archive for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/sabai-tech/contracteer/releases/latest) and extract it.

### Verify the installation

```bash
contracteer --version
```

## Verify a Server

`contracteer verify` sends requests to a running server and validates that responses conform to the OpenAPI specification.

```bash
contracteer verify openapi.yaml
```

The specification can be a local file path or an HTTP(S) URL.

The command exits with code `0` if all verification cases pass, `1` if any case fails.

**Options:**

- **`-u`, `--server-url`** *(default: `http://localhost`)* -- Base URL of the server.
- **`-p`, `--server-port`** *(default: `8080`)* -- Server port.
- **`-l`, `--log-level`** *(default: `INFO`)* -- Log verbosity: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, OFF.
- **`-t`, `--http-traffic`** -- Enable HTTP request/response logging.

Example with a custom URL and port:

```bash
contracteer verify openapi.yaml -u http://localhost -p 3000
```

To see every HTTP request and response:

```bash
contracteer verify openapi.yaml -t
```

Example output:

```
🚀 Starting contract verification...
Target Server: http://localhost:8080
Specification: openapi.yaml

   ✅ GET /musketeers -> 200 (application/json) (generated)
   ✅ GET /musketeers/{id} -> 200 (application/json) with scenario 'ATHOS'
   ✅ GET /musketeers/{id} -> 404 with scenario '404_UNKNOWN_MUSKETEER'
   ✅ GET /musketeers/{id} -> 400 (auto: path 'id' type mismatch)
   ❌ POST /musketeers (application/json) -> 400 (auto: body type mismatch)
     ↳ 'status code': expected <400> but was <500>

Result Summary:
   ⚠️ 1 errors found during verification.
   ✅ 4 verification cases passed.
```

Each line shows the verification case and its result.
Failed cases include the reason -- here, the server returned `500` instead of the expected `400`.

## Start a Mock Server

`contracteer mock` starts a mock server that validates requests and returns spec-compliant responses.
It runs until terminated (`Ctrl+C`).

```bash
contracteer mock openapi.yaml
```

The specification can be a local file path or an HTTP(S) URL.

**Options:**

- **`-p`, `--port`** *(default: `8080`)* -- Port for the mock server.
- **`-l`, `--log-level`** *(default: `INFO`)* -- Log verbosity: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, OFF.
- **`-t`, `--http-traffic`** -- Enable HTTP request/response logging.

Example on a custom port with traffic logging:

```bash
contracteer mock openapi.yaml -p 9090 -t
```

The mock server validates every incoming request against the OpenAPI schema.
If the request matches a scenario defined in the specification, it returns that scenario's response.
If the request is valid but matches no scenario, it generates a response from the schema.
If the request violates the specification and the operation defines a 400 response, the mock server returns `400`.
Otherwise, it returns `418` with diagnostic information.

The `418` is not a status code from your API.
It is Contracteer telling you that something is wrong or ambiguous.
The 418 body explains what happened -- read it before investigating further.

See [Testing Your Client](../concepts/testing-your-client.md) for a detailed explanation of mock server behavior.

## Try It Now

Start a mock server from the [Musketeer API](https://github.com/sabai-tech/contracteer-examples) specification without cloning anything:

```bash
contracteer mock https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sabai-tech/contracteer-examples/main/musketeer-spec/src/main/resources/musketeer-api.yaml -t
```

Then send a request:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/musketeers
```

The mock server returns a generated response conforming to the Musketeer schema.
